##Project 2:
Choose three of the wide "data sets" identified in Week 6 discussion items and practice tyding and Transformation of those data sets. 

The goal of this assignment is to give you practice in preparing different datasets for downstream analysis work.

###DATASET 1 :U.S Chronic Disease indicators

https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi-e50c9

*Dataset description:* The Center of Disease Control and Prevention provides and report chronic diseases data that are relevant information for hospitals, clinics and providers that allows states ,territories and metropolitan areas to access and tackle some indicators. 
*Dataset created date:* Jun 2, 2016
*Dataset updated date:* September 12, 2017
*Data Source:* The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS )
		           The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)

And many other government organizations that collects, analyzes and distributes information about chronic diseases state-wide. 
		
This dataset is wide enough containing *403984* observations. However, I used postgreSQL to create a small table called state_chronic filtering the observations where state = "NY" and Year is between 2015 and 2016.

#####Setting up enviroment
```{r}
library("DBI", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.4")
library("RPostgreSQL", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.4")
library(sqldf)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
#####Connectting with database  
```{r}
con = dbConnect(PostgreSQL(), user="postgres", password="Doradu8030",
                 host="localhost", port=5432, dbname="mysql")
```
#####Getting data from my new table state_chronic
```{r}
NY_chronic_ind = dbGetQuery(con,"select * from state_chronic")

s_chronic_ind <- transform(NY_chronic_ind, yearstart = as.numeric(yearstart), 
                                         yearend = as.numeric(yearend),
                                         datavalue = as.numeric(datavalue))

dim(s_chronic_ind)
str(s_chronic_ind)
```
*This data set contains 1180 observation for New York State only. The sample population is adults aged >= 18 years old and this data set analyzes categorical data by stratified random sampling, leading in the causes of disability and death in New York State*

Variables: 
yearStart: year in which the study starts = 2015 and 2016
yearEnd: year in which the study ends = 2015 and 2016
LocationAbbr: Abbreviation for state
Topic: categories that have reported as a possible cause of a chronic disease
Question: description of category given in string ex. Heavy drinking among adults aged >=18
QuestionID: identifiers of each question 
DataValuetypeID: Standardized rate decease identifier
DataValue: Percentage of acquire a chronic diseases and conditions base on each topic.
QuestionID: identifiers of each question
Stratification1: value for each stratification category ID1 ex. Female, male, Hispanic, black, white, etc.
StratificationCategoryID1: categories in which each observation is classified as gender, race and overall
 

After I studied each variable selected, I identified the variables "Question" and "Stratification1" that would need to be transformed for meaningful use.

```{r}
#droping NA values
table1 <- as_tibble(NY_chronic_ind)
table2 <- drop_na(table1, datavalue)

table2$stratification1 <- str_replace(table2$stratification1,"Female|Male" , "Gender")

#table2$stratification1 <- str_replace(table2$stratification1, pattern = "([:alpha:]+?.[:punct:][:punct:][:alpha:])","Race and Ethnicity" )

table2$stratificationid1 <- str_replace(table2$stratificationid1, "GENF", "FEMALE")
table2$stratificationid1 <- str_replace(table2$stratificationid1, "GENM", "MALE")

dim(table2)

```
```{r}  
g_topic <- group_by(s_chronic_ind,topic)
c_topic <- count(s_chronic_ind,topic) 
#number of obsevartions by topic
c_topic
```
```{r}
table2$datavalue <-  as.numeric(table2$datavalue)
fplot <- table2 %>% 
  group_by(topic) %>% 
  summarise(topsum = sum(datavalue, na.rm = T))
```
```{r}
ggplot(fplot, aes(topic, topsum))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1))+ coord_flip()+
  ggtitle('Posible causes of Death in New York')
```
```{r}  
g_topic <- group_by(s_chronic_ind,topic)
c_topic <- count(s_chronic_ind,topic) 
s_value <- summarise(s_chronic_ind, avg = mean(datavalue))
c_topic
```
###Data set 2 : Mortatily rates
Getting data 
```{r}
mort <- read.csv("C:/Users/Dora/CUNY/DATA607-Data Acquisition/Project2/MORT_READM_July2017.csv")
```
```{r}
plt1 <- mort %>% 
  group_by(Measure.as.Posted.on.Hospital.Compare) %>% 
  summarise(facSum = sum(VHA.National.Rate, na.rm = T))

ggplot(plt1, aes(Measure.as.Posted.on.Hospital.Compare, facSum))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1))+ coord_flip()+
  ggtitle('Mortatily Rates')
```
```{r}
mort$Number.Deaths.Readmissions <-  as.numeric(mort$Number.Deaths.Readmissions)
plt2 <- mort %>% 
  group_by(Measure.as.Posted.on.Hospital.Compare) %>% 
  summarise(facSum1 = sum(Number.Deaths.Readmissions,na.rm = T))

ggplot(plt2, aes(Measure.as.Posted.on.Hospital.Compare, facSum1))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1))+ coord_flip()+
  ggtitle('Hosp. Readmission Deaths ')
```

###Data set 3 : Quality Care
A list of the state averages for the HCAHPS survey responses. HCAHPS (the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) is a patient satisfaction survey required by CMS (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) for all hospitals in the United States. The Survey is for adult inpatients, excluding psychiatric patients.
Getting data 
```{r}
Qcare <- read.csv("C:/Users/Dora/CUNY/DATA607-Data Acquisition/Project2/Patient_survey_HCAHPS_State.csv")
```

```{r}
Qcare <- Qcare %>% mutate(timeDiff = difftime(as.POSIXct(as.Date(Qcare$Measure.End.Date,format = '%m/%d/%Y')), 
         as.POSIXct(as.Date(Qcare$Measure.Start.Date,format = '%m/%d/%Y')), 
         units = 'days'))
```
```{r}
Qcare$HCAHPS.Answer.PercentPercent <-  as.numeric(Qcare$HCAHPS.Answer.Percent)
plt <- Qcare %>% 
  group_by(HCAHPS.Question) %>% 
  summarise(facSum = sum(HCAHPS.Answer.PercentPercent, na.rm = T))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(plt, aes(HCAHPS.Question, facSum))+
geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1))+ coord_flip() +
  ggtitle('Quality of Treatment')
```

For a large plot as our peers indicated I had to call ggplot() from the console and save the image from the 'plot' tab on the right bottom pane of RStudio. Change the size. Paste the image in the RMD file. Make the chunk option for the ggplot call in the RMD file set as eval=FALSE.

```{r}
X<-dbDisconnect(con)
X
```
Note
I used the same plot for all three datasets because I found this format more meaninful to display several categories in a wide dataset.
